# OvertheBrain.github.io
Brian Han's personal website, built to publish self introductions and blogs.
The website is developed by the template based on [Gatsby's RolwinReevan Portfolio template](https://github.com/rolwin100/rolwinreevan_gatsby_blog) and [makersmelx's Gatsby Personal Website Template](https://github.com/makersmelx/makersmelx.github.io) using ant-design and mui.
The building process was done by **Gatsby** and the site is now deployed at **github-pages**.
There will be more commits to update the static pages.
