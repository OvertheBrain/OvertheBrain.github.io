###Hello, world! 
Here's my first blog post. Glad to see you as the witness of my journey on this websiteðŸŒŽ.

The main purpose of this website is to **demonstrate myself** from a ***technical but easy-going*** angel. **What I'm gonna do** in this website includes:

- ðŸ““ Write blogs about my tips for study or homework, topics in Software Engineering or Machine Learning and my comments on Animations watchedðŸ“º.
- ðŸ’» Share the portfolios during my study.
- ðŸ”§ Improve the front pages and functions continuously, such as the complement of portfolio filter, the addition of comment module, beautify the layout, etc.

The site is now deployed at <https://github.com/OvertheBrain/OvertheBrain.github.io>. If you have any advice or idea, please contact my E-mail or submit an issue on my Github page. Hope this will be a wonderful start~~
